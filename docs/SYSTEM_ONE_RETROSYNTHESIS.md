# System-One retrosynthesis: Jev-style prefill-only chemical decisions

## Status

Spin-off research path. This does **not** replace the frozen MechET paper protocol
or Issue #79 experiments.

## Motivation

The expensive part of the current closed-loop MechET policy is autoregressive
language generation.  Most local chemistry decisions are not open-ended text:
they select action types and graph locations from the current executor-owned
state.  A decision model is therefore a better architectural match.

This PR follows the public *Jev-like* design pattern implemented by projects
such as Kev and any2jev, without claiming access to TypeSafe AI's private Jev
architecture.  The reusable idea is:

1. encode the state once;
2. represent legal options explicitly;
3. score all options with a small pointer/readout head;
4. execute the selected chemical action;
5. encode the successor state for the next decision.

## Phase-0 architecture

The first implementation targets electron-flow localization because this is
already represented as a finite, executor-grounded option set in MechET.

```text
authoritative state S_t
        |
        v
small Qwen backbone + LoRA
(one prefill, no generation)
        |
        +--> atom/bond option states
        |
        v
Jev-style pointer readout
        |
        v
coupled source/sink distribution
        |
        v
deterministic MechET executor
        |
        v
S_{t+1}
```

The model is deliberately hierarchical rather than flattening every complete
reaction program into one classification problem.  Source candidates are atoms
and present bonds; sink candidates are atoms and unordered atom pairs.  The
primary training loss requires each reference source/sink pair in a multi-flow
event. One high-scoring flow is not treated as the whole event. For causal
atom-option readout, the current observation appends a gold-independent list
of atom handles *after* the full executor state. This is a derived input
contract, not byte-identical to the Stage-II text prefix.

## Why this is deployable on limited compute

- default backbone: `Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B`;
- LoRA instead of full fine-tuning;
- one causal-LM prefill per decision;
- no vLLM sampling loop and no JSON generation;
- pointer head is sub-million-scale relative to the backbone;
- first experiment can run on one H20/A100.

## Included entry points

```bash
python scripts/export_system_one_electron_flow.py \
  --input data/.../train.jsonl \
  --output outputs/system_one/train.decisions.jsonl

python scripts/train_system_one_electron_flow.py \
  --train data/.../train.jsonl \
  --valid data/.../valid.jsonl \
  --model Qwen/Qwen3-0.6B \
  --revision c1899de289a04d12100db370d81485cdf75e47ca \
  --epochs 1 \
  --output outputs/system_one/qwen3_0p6b
```

The exporter is an audit artifact; the trainer reads the original Stage-II rows,
verifies frozen split hashes and training permission, and appends only the
gold-independent option handles. Its `preflight.json` records source hashes,
decision denominators, token lengths and the exact input contract. The default
experiment is the mech-USPTO-31k **strict executable trace view** (10,152 /
1,319 / 1,253 reactions; 19,199 / 2,543 / 2,371 electron-event decisions),
not the full 24,959 / 3,120 / 3,120 endpoint benchmark.

## Promotion metrics

Phase 0 should report only metrics that directly test the decision architecture:

- coupled source/sink Recall@1/@4/@8;
- successor-state agreement after executor application;
- latency per decision;
- tokens processed per decision;
- peak GPU memory.

Current Phase-0 code measures paired localization, latency, tokens and memory.
The training report records successor agreement as unavailable rather than
mistaking site recall for chemical execution. A separate frozen-checkpoint
evaluator reconstructs temporary executor-only atom maps from the visible
annotated SMILES, checks that its regenerated public inventory is byte-exact,
and replays the prediction against the reference successor:

```bash
python scripts/eval_system_one_successor.py \
  --checkpoint outputs/agent/system_one_pr81_phase0_31k_20261005_v2/full \
  --valid data/mech_uspto_31k_natural_language_history_v2/valid.jsonl \
  --output outputs/agent/system_one_pr81_phase0_successor_valid
```

The evaluator reports fixed one-flow and two-flow policies that do not use the
answer, plus an explicitly labelled **oracle move-count diagnostic**. All are
local evaluations at reference current states; none is product-start endpoint
accuracy. Executor failure, successor chemistry and move-count strata are kept
separate, and test is not loaded. Promotion still requires competitive local
quality before a closed-loop rollout.

The evaluator's atom-address reconstruction has been independently audited on
the frozen train and valid event splits: GT pair indices replay to exactly the
same executor result as the original action for **19,199/19,199 train** and
**2,543/2,543 valid** events. Four train states acquire a different textual
`@`/`@@` serialization when RDKit removes temporary maps; their alias-indexed
graphs and canonical isomeric structures are unchanged. The replay check
allows only this chemically equivalent normalization, not atom-address or
stereochemical changes. These four rows remain in training.

Only after local decision quality is competitive should product-start endpoint
rollout be attempted.  No new RL algorithm is part of Phase 0.

## Next extensions

If Phase 0 works, merge IMPORT and FINISH into the same System-One interface via
an action-family head, then add calibrated abstention/branching.  The long-term
scientific question is whether retrosynthesis is better represented as
calibrated state-conditioned chemical decisions than as autoregressive text
generation.
